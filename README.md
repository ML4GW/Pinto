# Pinto
A command line utility for managing and running jobs in complex Python environments.

## Background
Most ongoing research in the [ML4GW](https://github.com/ML4GW) organization leverages [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for managing Python virtual environments in the context of a [Python monorepo](https://medium.com/opendoor-labs/our-python-monorepo-d34028f2b6fa). In particular, Poetry makes managing a shared set of libraries between jobs within a project [simple and straightforward](https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/#path-dependencies).

However, several tools in the Python gravitational wave analysis ecosystem cannot be installed via Pip (in particular the [library](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/python-ldas-tools-framecpp/) GWpy uses to read and write `.gwf` files and the library it uses for [reading archival data from the NDS2 server](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/python-nds2-client)). This complicates the environment management picture by having some projects which use Poetry to install local libraries as well as their own code into _Conda_ virtual environments, and others which don't require Conda at all and can install all the libraries they need into _Poetry_ virtual environments.

### Enter: `pinto`
Pinto  attempts to simplify this picture by installing a single tool in the base Conda environment which can dynamically detect whether a project requires Conda, create the appropriate virtual environment, and install all necessary libraries into it.

```console
pinto -p /path/to/my/project build
```

It can then be used to run jobs inside of that virtual environment.

```console
pinto -p /path/to/my/project run my-command --arg1
```

If you're currently in the project's directory, you can drop the `-p/--project` flag altogether for any pinto command, e.g.

```console
pinto build
pinto run my-command --arg1
```

## Structuring a project with Pinto
To leverage Pinto in a project, all you need is the [`pyproject.toml` file](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/) required by Poetry which specifies your project's dependencies. If just this file is present, `pinto` will treat your project as a "vanilla" Poetry project and manage all of its dependencies inside a Poetry virtual environment.

### But what if I need Conda?
Inidicating to Pinto that your project requires Conda is as simple as including a `poetry.toml` file in your project directory with the lines

```toml
[virtualenvs]
create = false
```

Alternatively, from you project directory you can run

```console
poetry config virtualenvs.create false --local
```

When building your project, `pinto` will first look for an entry that looks like

```toml
[tool.pinto]
base_env = "/path/to/environment.yaml"
```

In your project's `pyproject.toml`. If this entry doesn't exist, `pinto` will look for a file called either `environment.yaml` or `environment.yml` starting in your project's directory, then ascending up your directory tree to the root, using the first file it finds. This way, you can easily have a base `environment.yaml` in the root of a monorepo from on top of which all your projects build, while leaving projects the option of overriding this base image with their own `environment.yaml`.

In fact, if the `name` listed in the `environment.yaml` discovered by `pinto` ends with `-base`, `pinto` will automatically name your project's virtual environment `<prefix>-<project-name>`. For example, if the name of your project (as given in the `pyproject.toml`) is `nn-trainer`, and the `environment.yaml` at the root of your monorepo looks like

```yaml
name: myproject-base
dependencies:
    - ...
```

then `pinto` will name your project's virtual environment `myproject-nn-trainer`.

## Installation
### Container
The simplest way to get started with pinto is to run its container, which is made available through GitHub's container registry. You can pull it by running
```
docker pull ghcr.io/ML4GW/pinto:main
```
See [this document](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry) for information about how to authenticate to the GitHub container reigstry.

### Conda
Pinto can only be installed on top of Anaconda, so make sure you have a `local` install available to work with (instructions found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). I particularly recommend using Miniconda for a bare install, since most your work will be in virtual environments anyway.

Your options are then to either install `pinto` in the `base` conda environment (recommended), or in a virtual environment. If you choose to go the latter route, the conda environments managed by pinto will be kept in a subdirectory of pinto's environment.

#### Installing in the base conda environment
First install poetry via pip
```console
(base) ~$ python -m pip install "poetry>1.2.0"
```
then install pinto via pip
```console
(base) ~$ python -m pip install git+https://github.com/ML4GW/pinto@main
```

#### In a virtual environment
If you don't want to install pinto into your `base` conda environment, you can install it by creating an environment file like the one found [here](./environment.yaml), and creating a virtual environment like:
```console
(base) ~$ conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
You can then activate your pinto environment and execute commands inside of it
```console
(base) ~$ conda activate pinto
(pinto) ~$ pinto --version
```

### Setting the Poetry virtualenvs path
Whether you installed pinto your base environment or in a virtual environment, we recommend setting up Poetry's default virtual environment path so that it installs environments to the same location as conda. With the desired environment activated, run
```console
(base OR pinto) ~$ poetry config virtualenvs.path $CONDA_PREFIX/envs
```

### Development Installation
To develop pinto, clone the repo locally
```console
(base) ~$ git clone https://github.com/ML4GW/pinto.git
```
Then complete either installation method above, but with the local library installed editably. For base installs:
```console
(base) ~$ python -m pip install ./pinto[dev]
```

For virtual environment installs, edit the `environment.yaml` so that the pinto install line is replaced with
```yaml
  - -e .[dev]
```
Then run
```console
(base) ~$ cd pinto
(base) ~$ conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
